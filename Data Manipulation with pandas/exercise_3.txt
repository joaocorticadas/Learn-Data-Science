Exercise 1: Load and Inspect the Data

  1.	Load the real_estate.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame.
  2.	Print the first five rows using .head().
  3.	Print the summary information about the DataFrame using .info().
  4.	Print the shape of the DataFrame using .shape.

Exercise 2: Sorting the Data

  1.	Sort the data by price in ascending order and print the result.
  2.	Sort the data by price in descending order.
  3.	Sort the data by price and square_feet in descending order.

Exercise 3: Subsetting the Data

  1.	Subset the data to show only the location, type, and price columns.
  2.	Subset the rows to show only properties that have more than 1500 square feet.
  3.	Subset the rows to show only properties of the type “House.”

Exercise 4: Adding New Columns

  1.	Add a new column called price_per_sqft, which is the price divided by the square feet.
  2.	Add another column called price_in_million, which is the price in millions (e.g., 950000 becomes 0.95).

Exercise 5: Filtering and Sorting Based on Conditions

  1.	Filter the properties with price_per_sqft greater than 800.
  2.	Sort these properties by price_in_million in descending order.
  3.	Print the location, price_in_million, and price_per_sqft columns of the filtered properties.
